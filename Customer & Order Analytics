#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT count(orderID) FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT count(orderID) FROM Jansales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';
    
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum FROM customers
JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderid
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT product, price FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, quantity, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue   FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(order_id) AS customers, quantity, avg(quantity*price) AS AVERAGE FROM customers
JOIN FebSales
ON order_id=orderID
WHERE length(order_id)=6 AND Quantity > 2;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 

SELECT location, product, sum(quantity) FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
