-- In this SQL, I am querying a table named superstore to showcase the different ways I can aggregate data.

-- Write a SQL query that orders the items by price.

SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 5;

-- Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count.

SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore;

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore;

SELECT MIN(price)
FROM superstore;

SELECT MAX(price)
FROM superstore;

--Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".

--Which Kithcen supply costs the most?

SELECT item_name, category, MAX(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies'
ORDER BY price DESC;

--The Stainless Steel Cookware costs the most.

-- Come up with your own question about the data and try to answer it using SQL. For example: How many air purifiers are in stock?

SELECT item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name = "Air Purifier";

--Which electronic has the highest rating?

SELECT item_name, MAX(average_rating)
FROM superstore
WHERE category = 'Electronics';

-- The Smart LED TV has the highest rating at 4.5
